# PHP â€“ Hypertext Processor and frameworks: a LARAVEL based Web application


This project has the scope of learning and understanding techniques and concepts especially used in web applications, as well as the way other programming languages can be adapted and used exclusively for this kind of applications. 
Therefore, in the scope of creating a software web application, the following components were used: Hypertext preprocessor language (also world widely known as PHP programming language), a language-specifically framework named Laravel and one of the mostly used software architecture pattern for these types of software application, the MVC architecture (Model-View-Controller). As this application is considered to implement user-friendly interfaces, this type of architecture will help achieving this goal.
In order to understand better the interaction between al of the components previously described, in the Chapter 2 below they will be separately presented, as well as the communication flow between each one of them, in order to achieve the scope of creating a User Interface Web Application.
